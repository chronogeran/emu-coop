# emu-coop

This directory contains some Lua scripts that, when loaded by a compliant emulator such as snes9x-rr or FCEUX, can synchronize emulator state over the internet (allowing "cooperative" playthroughs of single-player games).

Each game you want to use this with requires a "mode" file in the modes/ directory. **WARNING: Modes are PROGRAMS, like a .exe file. Do not install a mode file unless it came from someone you know and trust.** 

To run, run coop.lua. To run with additional debug messages (more verbose errors, and visibility for every message sent) run debug.lua instead.
